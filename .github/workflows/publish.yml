# ⚠️  STATUS: BROKEN AS OF DECEMBER 2025
#
# npm changed their authentication system:
# - Classic tokens were permanently revoked (Dec 9, 2025)
# - Passkey-only 2FA is now enforced for new setups
# - Passkeys require browser interaction, cannot be used in CI/CD
#
# CURRENT WORKAROUND: Publish locally after running release-sdk.sh
#   cd packages/sdk && npm run build && npm publish --access public
#
# This workflow is kept for future use if npm adds CI/CD support for passkeys
# or OIDC trusted publishing starts working properly.
#
# See: https://github.blog/changelog/2025-12-09-npm-classic-tokens-revoked-session-based-auth-and-cli-token-management-now-available/
